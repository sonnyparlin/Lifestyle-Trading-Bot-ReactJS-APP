The <a  target="_new"  href="https://lifestylecalculator.xyz/">Lifestyle Trading Bot Calculator</a> is a calculator app for the <a target="_new" href="https://t.me/LifeStyleTrading_Bot?start=1wgcys1037">Lifestyle Trading Bot</a>. The Lifestyle Trading Bot accepts a deposit made via bitcoin to a one time address it provides to you each time you invest. As soon as the deposit is made you will start earning 0.466% of what you invested <b>every day</b> for 365 days. Once your balance reaches \$100 you can either take the money out or reinvest it, or you can simply wait and collect. This app is not affiliated with the LTB program, I am just a fan and fellow investor. 

However, I'm happy to answer questions about the investment program via <a  href="https://t.me/sonnygrapples">telegram</a>. You can see what's happening under the hood by opening your browser's developer tools and clicking on the console.

### FAQ: 

**Why don't the numbers change when I change the reinvestment interval?**
* If your initial investment produces a return that's less than what you would make in your reinvestment interval, the app will simply keep adding your returns to your balance until it reaches the target number to be reinvested. If you put a low number like 100 into the investment box, you won't see anything change until about the six month mark.

**How does the bot work?**
* First thing is first, you need to download the <a href="https://telegram.org/">telegram app</a>, they have apps for iPhone, Android and Desktop. Once you've downloaded the app, click on this link: https://t.me/LifeStyleTrading_Bot?start=1wgcys1037, which will bring you to the bot. You invest a specific amount of money via bitcoin. Once the bot recieves the payment it begins paying you 0.466% of your investment 24 hours later for a total of 365 days. After the 365 days is over you will have a nice return, but if you reinvest your return, you can compound your earnings very quickly. The qickest way I've been able to invest is to use <a href="https://cash.app/">Cash App</a> to buy my bitcoin because I'm able to send it immediately after buying it. Some exchanges make you wait a few days and it's possible you could lose money if the price of bitcoin drops in that time. If you find yourself in a situation where you can't send your bitcoin right away, you can always transfer your bitcoin to a stablecooin like Dai or Tether or USD Coin while you wait for your funds to clear. 

**Is the Lifestyle Trading Bot safe?**
* It's as safe as any other investment opportunity, they do have a <a href="https://lifestyletrading.xyz">web site</a> and they respond to support requests and I personally know people who have had and continue to have a lot of success with this investment. Make your own decisions.

**What are the tax implications?**
* I have no idea, that's what I pay an accountant for.
